# The-wage-divide

The poem highlights the major issues relating to the wage gap in various industries.
On load the poem displays the scatterplot showing the median women earnings on the x axis and the median earnings of men on the y axis.
When you hover the data points the name of the occupation/ sector is shown. The reason hovering was used instead of displaying the legend for the last 2 scatter plots is that the category/ occupation names for those were very long
